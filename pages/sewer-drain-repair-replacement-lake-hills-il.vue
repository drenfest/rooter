<h3>Common Sewer Line Problems in Lake In The Hills, IL</h3>
<p>Transporting waste water from your home to the underground sewer main is what your sewer lines do best, until something goes wrong. Common sewer line issues include:</p>
<h4>Oily Deposits </h4>
<p>One of the chief enemies of any sewer line is a buildup of oily deposits. Oily substances like fat and grease cling to pipe walls and edges, accumulating over time and constricting the flow of waste water. Foreign objects often get stuck in the deposits, which further impedes proper drainage and can lead to clogged pipes and backed up sewer lines. With preventative sewer services from Rooter Inc., our plumbers can help clear out oily deposits before they become a major problem.</p>
<h4>Sewer Line Clog </h4>
<p>The most common red flag of a sewer line clog is water backing up out of your drain or toilet plumbing, or a gurgling sound coming from the drains. Clogs can be difficult to track because they can occur in the main or secondary lines of the sewer system, but the professional plumbers at our company use the latest technology and equipment in the industry to locate the clog and get rid of it fast.</p>
<h4>Tree Root Infestation </h4>
<p>Invasive tree roots can pose a serious threat to your sewer lines. The smallest crack or fissure in a sewer line can attract tree roots, which are constantly in search of moisture and nutrients. If left unchecked, the pipes could burst and lead to a major clean-up project. Fortunately, Cupertino Plumbing uses hydro-jetting to effectively clear any tree roots that have taken hold in your sewer line. If your sewer pipes are beyond repair, we also offer reliable sewer replacement services to fit your needs.</p>
